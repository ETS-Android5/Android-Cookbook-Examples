= flutter_demo

A trivial demo Flutter application, that opens in Adroid Studio
and can be built for Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, and the web.
Unlike a traditional Android app where the source is in _app/src/main/java/pkg_name_,
a Flutter app's main source is in the _lib/_ folder.
Neither of these naming conventions is ideal, but at least Flutter's is short.

Flutter apps are written in the Dart language, but you can add code
in Java or Kotlin for Android, and in Objective C or Swift for iOS.
